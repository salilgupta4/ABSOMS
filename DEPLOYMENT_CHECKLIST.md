## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy
```

### Firebase Hosting Setup
- Public directory: `dist`
- Single page app rewrites configured
- Proper ignore patterns set

## üìã Pre-Deployment Verification

### Essential Checks
1. [ ] Verify Firebase project configuration
2. [ ] Test user authentication flow
3. [ ] Verify all module permissions work correctly
4. [ ] Test critical user workflows (create orders, run payroll, etc.)
5. [ ] Verify all month filters work in payroll
6. [ ] Test PDF generation and printing functionality
7. [ ] Check responsive design on mobile devices

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. [ ] Monitor for JavaScript errors in browser console
2. [ ] Verify Firebase security rules are working
3. [ ] Test user access controls thoroughly
4. [ ] Monitor performance metrics
5. [ ] Verify all integrations are working (Email, PDF export, etc.)

## üìä Build Statistics

### Current Build Output
- **CSS**: 73.01 kB (11.51 kB gzipped)
- **Vendor chunk**: 224.37 kB (71.26 kB gzipped)
- **Firebase chunk**: 535.64 kB (123.77 kB gzipped)  
- **PDF chunk**: 555.85 kB (162.36 kB gzipped)
- **Main app**: 675.74 kB (135.24 kB gzipped)

### Performance Optimizations Applied
- Code splitting for better caching
- Console statements removed in production
- Terser minification enabled
- Asset compression configured

## üîê Security Considerations

### Firestore Security
- Authentication required for all operations
- Module-based access control enforced
- Admin-only operations protected
- User data isolation implemented

### Environment Variables
- Ensure production Firebase config is used
- Verify API keys are properly configured
- Check that sensitive data is not exposed
